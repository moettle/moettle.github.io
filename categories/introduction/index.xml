More often than not, half of the people in a meeting won&amp;rsquo;t even know what an abbreviation means, but nobody would dare to ask. Furthermore, it is nearly impossible for newcomers to grasp a topic when people consistently use abbreviations without explaining them. You can ask any employee of a company with more than 50,000 employees how much they appreciate abbreviations. Every department tends to have its own set of abbreviations, and company-wide, most abbreviations aren&amp;rsquo;t even unique. Okay, enough complaining about abbreviations; I think you&amp;rsquo;ve got the idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While I&amp;rsquo;ve expressed my frustration with abbreviations, this article aims to provide an introduction to the most commonly used terms in Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR). Oh wow, it&amp;rsquo;s not that difficult to write out an abbreviation, is it? The article also serves the purpose of defining terms that might have multiple meanings in different companies, countries, vendors, etc.&lt;/p>

&lt;td>Command and Control (C2, C&amp;amp;C)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>A method for threat actors to remotely control a compromised system over the network. C2 typically involves a compromised system and a C2 server for control, often using simple HTTP or HTTPS channels to evade detection among an organization&amp;rsquo;s usual network traffic.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>A team of security experts specialized in handling cyberattacks and security incidents, which may not be limited to organizations; some countries have their own CERTs, and even the EU has one.&lt;/td>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Denial-of-Service (DOS)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>An attack with the goal of disrupting the availability of a system or service, often achieved by flooding the server with requests.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Digital Forensics (DF)&lt;/td>

&lt;td>A DOS attack where the flooding comes from multiple systems, commonly achieved through request amplification or bot networks.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Endpoint Detection &amp;amp; Response (EDR)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>A security tool that detects threats and unusual behavior on endpoints and enables a company to respond effectively to alerts. EDR collects all endpoint events centrally and offers response features like isolation, containment, live response, and more, surpassing traditional antivirus solutions.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Entra ID&lt;/td>
&lt;td>See Azure Active Directory (AAD)&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Evidence Acquisition&lt;/td>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Network Operation Center (NOC)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>A team that monitors the network traffic of an organization. Many organizations don&amp;rsquo;t have a NOC anymore but rather a monitoring team in general or a SIEM team, which also covers network monitoring. Since network monitoring is only a part of a complete monitoring strategy, it often resolves in a large monitoring team.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Network Security Monitoring (NSM)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>The continuous monitoring of network traffic to detect malicious activity.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Purple Team&lt;/td>
&lt;td>A collaboration between a blue team (defense) and a red team (offense) working together in a coordinated manner.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Red Team&lt;/td>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Remediation&lt;/td>
&lt;td>The act of mitigating an attack after it has occurred, aiming to regain control over the infrastructure, remove attackers from systems, and return to normal operations. Forensics analysis is essential for defining effective remediation measures, which may include reinstalling compromised systems, changing passwords on abused accounts, or enhancing security to prevent the same incident in the future.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Reverse Engineering (RE)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Part of malware analysis, involving reconstructing the original source code of a compiled malware sample to understand its functionality.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>

&lt;td>An IOC scanner specialized in detecting traces of attacks on endpoints, offering over 10,000 signatures and various modules for system scanning. A free variant, Thor-lite, is also available.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Threat Intelligence (TI)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>The process of gathering information about current cyber threats and risks, utilized for prevention, detection, or response to incidents within an organization.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Threat Hunting&lt;/td>
&lt;td>The proactive search for traces of attacks within an organization, often initiated by new reports, ideas for identifying attackers, or management concerns. Threat hunting is commonly performed in EDR or SIEM systems.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>

&lt;td>TLP is a tagging system for shared information specifying sharing options for recipients. It includes four labels: TLP:RED (For recipient only), TLP:AMBER (Limited disclosure, e.g., within the organization), TLP:GREEN (Limited disclosure, e.g., within a community), and TLP:CLEAR (No limitations, shared information can be published).&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Windows Event Forwarding (WEF)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>The forwarding of Windows Event logs to a central server, which is supported by Windows by default and is for free, making it an excellent way to collect all Windows Event Logs in one place, simplifying log management.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>YARA (Yet Another Ridiculous Acronym)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>YARA provides a standard for writing detection signatures and offers a scanner to apply them to files or directories, serving as the de-facto standard for signature writing for files.&lt;/td>
