&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Surprised? Let me guess—you thought forensics was the heart of every incident response. While forensics is a crucial part of Incident response, it is definitely not its heart. The following article makes it clear why.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Too often, I’m thrown into an ongoing incident where an &amp;ldquo;Incident Response Provider&amp;rdquo; is already involved. So why would the customer bring in a second incident response provider if one is already on board?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing I do, when I get thrown in such an incident, is test the waters with a few simple questions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What are the ongoing tasks and who is responsible for them?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Where is the current situational overview, and who is updating it?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are there established working streams?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Where are the results of the different working streams documented?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When I’m met with blank stares, I immediately know what’s happening: the so-called &amp;ldquo;Incident Response Provider&amp;rdquo; is just another forensics provider. They are selling forensic analysis as incident response while neglecting the most critical part—incident coordination.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before diving into what incident coordination entails, let’s first discuss the fundamental building blocks of incident response.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-building-blocks-of-incident-response">The Building Blocks of Incident Response
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Every incident response effort consists of several key building blocks, also often called working streams. Basically teams working a specific part of the IR assessment:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Incident Coordination&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The glue that holds everything together, ensuring all aspects of the response function smoothly. That&amp;rsquo;s why I called in the heart of every incident.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Assigning responsibilities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Assigning and tracking tasks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keeping all teams aligned&lt;/li>
&lt;li>More details in the next section&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Digital forensics&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Evidence Acquisition&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Performing forensic analysis&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Assessing the extent of the attack&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Identifying attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Determining the impact of the attack&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Monitoring and Threat Hunting&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Watching for new attacker activity using TTPs and IOCs from forensics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Proactively hunting for additional compromised assets (systems, identities, etc.)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Remediation&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This building block is the reason why we perform all the other building blocks. In the end we want to get rid of the attacker and establish a clean base-line&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In this building block we need to implement a set of measures to achieve that&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The results from digital forensics (especially the extent of the attack) comes in very handy here&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Lessons Learned&lt;/strong> (usually not a working stream but something you do after the remediation)
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>After remediation is done and successful, it&amp;rsquo;s time to learn your lessons&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can we avoid such incidents in the future?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can we improve our prevention, detection, and response?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="the-role-of-incident-coordination">The Role of Incident Coordination
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>As an incident coordinator you are effectively leading the whole incident and it&amp;rsquo;s your responsibility the resolve the incident. Therefore a multitude of tasks must be performed in the coordination building block. These tasks involve&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Setting up and moderating regular status calls with all stakeholders&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Documenting and tracking status updates&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Assigning and tracking ongoing tasks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Collecting results of all fulfilled tasks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ensuring critical decisions are made and documented&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gathering and consolidating findings from all workstreams to maintain a situational overview&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Translating technical findings for management&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Communicating management decisions effectively to technical teams&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ensuring all workstreams receive the necessary information&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Note that some of tasks can be delegated or supported by others, but responsibility ultimately falls back to you as an Incident Coordinator.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="why-incident-coordination-is-rare">Why Incident Coordination Is Rare
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>The reason why there are so many providers not able to offer incident coordination is because high-quality incident coordinators are very rare. The role requires a unique combination of skills:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Highly organized&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Incidents are chaotic, especially in the beginning&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An Incident Coordinator must keep track of numerous moving parts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every little thing that gets overlooked might cause huge damage later on in the incident (e.g. you forgot to turn of one compromised system &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Your containment was incomplete and the attacker persists)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>High-level view&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>While forensic analysis like to get lost in technical details, someone needs to keep a high-level view of everything happening. This task goes to the incident coordinator&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Excellent communication skills&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Since you have to communicate with forensic analysts as well as high-level management, you better work on your situational communication skills. Otherwise the analysts won&amp;rsquo;t respect you and management won&amp;rsquo;t understand you&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your moderation skills should also be strong since you often have to moderated chaotic calls and it&amp;rsquo;s on you to direct everyone in a productive direction&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sufficient technical know-how&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>First of all you need sufficient know-how about how incidents, incident response, and cyber attacks work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Next you need to know typical measures of containment, evidence acquisition, forensics and remediation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To be able to communicate and direct the Digital Forensics block, you should have forensic experience yourself&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Incident Response Experience&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It takes years of hands-on Incident response experience until you are able to lead major incidents like APTs, Ransomware or Bad Insiders&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ability to Stay Calm Under Pressure&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If the incident coordinator starts to panic, everybody is going to panic&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you have all the skills described above, keeping calm shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem :)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Now you know why Incident coordinators are rare. If you happen to find one, keep them and never let them go…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you happen to be in the DACH region, we are training Incident Coordinators and Managers. So feel free to reach out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One final piece of advice: if you&amp;rsquo;re selecting an Incident Response provider, always ask how they manage and coordinate an incident. If they don’t have a clear answer, you’re usually dealing with a forensics provider, not a true Incident Response. If you are looking for a forensics provider, this is fine. If you are looking for an Incident Response provider, you should keep looking.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blueteamsec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Reddit BlueTeamSec&lt;/a> and Twitter with the filters mentioned below, will provide you with most of the information you&amp;rsquo;ll need on a daily basis.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Whether you are a novice or a seasoned professional in the field of DFIR, it is crucial to know reliable and comprehensive sources for obtaining information and staying updated. It is equally important to remain open to discovering new resources that can enhance your knowledge. If you have new sources, which are not yet in this list, just send me a message on Twitter or an email.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following compilation has expanded in recent years and will continue to evolve in this rapidly changing domain. Some resources may be removed or replaced over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To gather the majority of my news, I prefer utilizing RSS feeds within my email application. This approach proves convenient as the news articles are delivered directly to my inbox, which I check on a daily basis. However, since not all resources offer RSS feeds and some are more interactive (such as Twitter), it becomes necessary to manually check these sources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sources comprise not only DFIR-related material but also a wide range of topics within the realm of cybersecurity. This includes defensive and offensive security, threat landscapes, cyber politics (with a focus on Europe), and more. As an Incident Responder, it is crucial to stay informed about the entire cybersecurity landscape. Relying solely on forensic blogs would provide a limited perspective. While you may possess excellent technical analysis skills for dissecting each system forensically, you would lack the contextual information about the attacks. Contextual information often offers valuable insights into the motivation, capabilities, and objectives of the attacks. For instance, considering the ongoing Ukraine war, attacks on critical infrastructure in Europe are currently more likely to originate from Russia compared to other countries like China or the US. This is not to imply that all attacks come from Russia, but rather that the circumstances increase the probability of such occurrences. Hence, it is important to stay updated about these circumstances and have the big picture in mind while responding to incidents.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="sources">Sources
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>The following are some of my favorite sources. I added links to RSS feeds and Twitter wherever possible and useful, so you can easily subscribe to them.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="twitter">Twitter
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>&lt;strong>This section is slightly deprecated since TweetDeck is not freely available anymore, and X is loosing importance. The search for tags still works.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the best platform to get the newest information about cybersecurity is Twitter. For a long time Twitter was the go-to platform for the whole community to share information and news about the newest attacks. Penetration testers share their newest tools and exploits, and threat analysts share their newest intel about current attacks. Since Musk has bought Twitter parts of the community moved to Mastodon or other platforms but still, Twitter is a platform rich in information on cybersecurity. The only thing you need to know is how to use it effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Twitter lets you search for certain tags in their search field. The best tags on Twitter include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>#CyberSecurity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#CyberSec&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#InfoSec&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#CyberAttacks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#DigitalSecurity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#CyberRisk&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#DFIR&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#IncidentResponse&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#DigitalForensics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#BlueTeam&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#DefensiveSecurity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#ThreatIntelligence&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#ThreatIntel&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#ThreatHunting&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#ThreatAnalysis&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#APT&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#CTI&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#OSINT&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#SOC&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#SIEM&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#Yara&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#0Day&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#MalwareAnalysis&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#Malware&lt;/li>
&lt;li>#Ransomware&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>To bring Twitter&amp;rsquo;s tags to a next level, I use these tags on &lt;a class="link" href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>TweetDeck&lt;/a> in different columns, as shown below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Main feed&lt;/strong>: Getting news from the people I follow, which might not use tags at all. Note that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t combine your private and your professional Twitter, otherwise this feed would be full of posts that distract you during work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>General news about cybersecurity&lt;/strong>:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>#CyberSecurity OR #CyberSec OR #InfoSec OR #CyberAttacks OR #DigitalSecurity OR #CyberRisk&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>DFIR-related posts&lt;/strong>:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>#DFIR OR #IncidentResponse OR #DigitalForensics OR #BlueTeam OR #DefensiveSecurity&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>TI-related posts&lt;/strong>:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>#ThreatIntelligence OR #ThreatIntel OR #ThreatHunting OR #ThreatAnalysis OR #Yara&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Optional: current topic you want to track like a new vulnerability&lt;/li>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>In a recent incident response assessment, our encounter with the ransomware group Black Basta shed light on their tactics. Although they were able to get initial access to a server system an early detection enabled us to contain and remediate the incident shortly after. What&amp;rsquo;s interesting are the activities performed by Black Basta during their brief presence on the compromised system. Forensic analysis provided us with invaluable insights, including high quality IOCs, which we recently published &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/hvs-consulting/ioc_signatures/tree/main/BlackBasta" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>[1]&lt;/a>. Besides the forensics findings, this article shows once again that established ransomware groups often lack sophistication and can be protected against.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After gaining initial access, Black Basta attempted to deploy a beacon calling back to their C2 infrastructure. Since the server did not have direct access to the internet (outgoing traffic was very limited), the operator started to panic. In the following hour, the Black Basta operator tried various ways to reach their C2 infrastructure, thereby disclosing executed commands, IPs, as well as domains belonging to the C2 infrastructure. The attack showed similarities to the attack observed by TrendMicro &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.trendmicro.com/de_de/research/24/b/threat-actor-groups-including-black-basta-are-exploiting-recent-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>[2]&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="iocs">IOCs
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>You can find our published IOCs on our Github repository &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/hvs-consulting/ioc_signatures/tree/main/BlackBasta" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>[1]&lt;/a>, which also includes an export of our MISP event with more detailed descriptions and tagging. Since our observed attack and the attack observed by TrendMicro showed various parallels, we included TrendMicro&amp;rsquo;s IOCs to provide a more comprehensive collection of Black Basta IOCs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following list of IPs and Domains have a very high certainty, since all of them were pinged while the operator was trying to get a connection to their C2 infrastructure. Since outgoing ICMP traffic was not allowed (unknown to the operator), they started to try out every C2 endpoint know to them. Very clumsly indeed but very fruitful for us :)&lt;/p>

Such reports often lack crucial parts to help others in defending themselves against these threats. After finding another bad threat recently, I decided to write a constructive blog post on how to read and write threat reports.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="tldr">TL;DR
&lt;/h1>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Include an actionable management summary&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Provide a comprehensive technical timeline&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Utilize the &lt;a class="link" href="https://attack.mitre.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK® framework&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Provide IOCs and use a standardized way to share them. For example via a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.misp-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>MISP&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write Yara signatures&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write SIGMA signatures&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reference other reports about the same threat&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use a consistent Timezone, ideally UTC+0. In any case, specify the timezone you are using.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="what-is-a-threat-report-even">What is a threat report even?
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>A threat report is a document or publication that provides detailed information about specific (current) cyber threats. These reports are typically authored by cybersecurity organizations, government agencies, or security vendors with the primary objective of keeping organizations and individuals well-informed about the latest threats in the cyber space. Most often these reports are published after an IR engagement. Hence, the report usually covers a single attack, or a set of attacks performed by the same threat actor. A threat report should not be confused with a report about a threat landscape, which has a bigger picture in mind. In this article, we will delve into the specifics of threat / incident response reports.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="contents-of-a-threat-report">Contents of a threat report
&lt;/h1>&lt;h2 id="management-summary">Management Summary
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>To kick things off, let&amp;rsquo;s address one of the often-overlooked but crucial elements missing in most threat reports: the management summary. Typically, these reports are tailored for a niche audience – those engaged in Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR). Undoubtedly, the information contained therein is immensely valuable for this specific group, aiding them in fine-tuning their detection strategies for this specific attack. However, what if the incident responder reads the report and wants to prevent the attack in the future, for example by disabling Office macros or by rolling out a new security tool. The incident responder runs to the management, presents the report and urges them to action. Management looks at the report and the first sentence they see is something like:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&amp;#34;&amp;lt;fancy name&amp;gt; (aka &amp;lt;more fancy names&amp;gt;) attacker group managed to infiltrate company XYZ by abusing
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&amp;lt;fancy vulnerability name&amp;gt; and deploying &amp;lt;fancy malware name&amp;gt;&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>In such cases, the management may find it challenging to immediately grasp the gravity of the situation, given the technical jargon and intricacies presented upfront. This is precisely where an effective management summary comes into play, providing a concise yet comprehensive overview that bridges the gap between the technical details and the need for strategic decisions at a higher level within the organization. Instead of sounding all fancy and technically sophisticated in the first section, it should rather sound something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&amp;#34;Company XYZ was hacked by an attacker due to bad patch management. The impact from the attack resulted in a halt
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">of production for several days, which caused X million in damage for the company. The attack could have been
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">prevented through fast emergency patches.&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now management actually has a chance to understand what the report is trying to convey and what potential consequences could arise from the described threat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A rule of thumb here: &lt;strong>If is sounds cool to you as an incident responder, management won&amp;rsquo;t understand it. If is sounds straightforward and plain, there is a higher chance that management will understand.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What should be included in a management summary:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Clarity and Simplicity&lt;/strong>: Write in a non-technical and easily comprehensible manner.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Impact Assessment&lt;/strong>: Explain the impact or damage caused by the attack, and if possible, quantify it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Incident Overview&lt;/strong>: Provide a concise description of what occurred.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Preventive Measures&lt;/strong>: Offer recommendations on how to prevent a similar incident in other organizations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Visualization&lt;/strong>: Include any necessary visual aids to illustrate the attack, making it more accessible to non-technical readers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Timeline&lt;/strong>: Optionally, include a high-level timeline to demonstrate how rapidly an attack can disrupt a company.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In 2022 I co-authored a threat report&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.hvs-consulting.de/public/ThreatReport-EmissaryPanda.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>[1]&lt;/a> on a threat actor called Emissary Panda, which was harvesting major vulnerabilities like ProxyLogon at that time and engaging in industrial espionage. Since we received a lot of positive feedback from Incident Responders and managers, I would like to show you some highlights of the report, starting with the management summary. The first page after the table of contents contains an abstract, which serves as a management summary. It adheres to the tips given above and contains a summary written in non-technical terms as well as easy to understand recommendations:&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can see, the report even contains a link to a separate summary targeting management&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.hvs-consulting.de/en/threat-intelligence-report-emissary-panda-apt27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>[2]&lt;/a>. Furthermore, it contains easy to understand recommendations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="technical-timeline">Technical Timeline
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve covered the management aspect in depth, let&amp;rsquo;s delve into the technical aspects of a threat report. Before we go into executed commands, used malware, and attacker infrastructure, the reader needs to gain an understanding of the attack. The report should provide that in form of visualization of the attack and technical timelines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One publisher that often combines visualization and timeline in a single, beautiful image is &lt;a class="link" href="https://thedfirreport.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>The DFIR Report&lt;/a>. The following timeline was taken from one of their latest reports&lt;a class="link" href="https://thedfirreport.com/2023/02/06/collect-exfiltrate-sleep-repeat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>[3]&lt;/a>. I love these timelines because they offer a quick overview as well as the most critical technical details of an attack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://dfir-delight.de/p/threat-reports/Threat_Report_TheDFIRReport.png"

class="gallery-image"
data-flex-grow="115"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another approach to presenting a technical timeline is to separate the visualization from the actual timeline by placing it in a dedicated table. This is what we did in our report&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.hvs-consulting.de/public/ThreatReport-EmissaryPanda.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;h2 id="mapping-the-attack-to-mitre-attck">Mapping the attack to MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK®
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The next section delves deeper into the technical aspects of the attack by leveraging the &lt;a class="link" href="https://attack.mitre.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK® framework&lt;/a>. By aligning the analyzed attack with MITRE&amp;rsquo;s tactics and procedures, defenders can swiftly grasp the attack and determine how to detect or mitigate it within their environment. The report should include a MITRE map created with the &lt;a class="link" href="https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK® Navigator&lt;/a> as well as a detailed and technical description of each used technique.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The descriptions of the used techniques should have the highest level of technical details, including the tools used, command-lines, and more. Why? Let me illustrate that with an example from another threat report we released in 2021 about Lazarus&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.hvs-consulting.de/public/ThreatReport-Lazarus.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>[4]&lt;/a>, a North Korean threat actor:&lt;/p>

class="gallery-image"
data-flex-grow="290"
data-flex-basis="698px"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In that report, we disclosed the entire command-line, including the password used to decrypt the embedded payload. Approximately 1.5 years later, an incident responder from ESET encountered another attack from Lazarus, still employing the same malware. Although, the ESET researchers were not able to catch the password live from the command-line, they found our report and were able to decrypt the payload with the contained password used in the command-line &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/09/30/amazon-themed-campaigns-lazarus-netherlands-belgium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>[5]&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="detection">Detection
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A threat report should empower others to detect the same attack in their environment. This is typically accomplished by sharing Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) or detection signatures.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="indicators-of-compromise">Indicators of Compromise
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>IOCs, as described in my &lt;a class="link" href="https://dfir-delight.de/glossary" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Glossary&lt;/a>, encompass indicators such as filenames, hashes, URLs, domains, IPs, command lines, registry keys, and more. These indicators are crucial for detecting compromises or attacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, sharing IOCs comes with several challenges, some of which I intend to explore in a dedicated blog post. For now, let me highlight the main issues associated with sharing IOCs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>IOC types are only semi-standardized. The closest thing to a standardized format for IOCs can be found in the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.misp-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>MISP Project&lt;/a>. Since most people are still sharing indicators like its 1982, defenders still have to deal with poorly formatted tables in PDF and Excel sheets, and self-defined type names. You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t believe how many ways there are to title an IPv4 address: IP, IP4, IP-v4, IPv4, etc. An IPv4 address is still one of the easy types to title, now think about how you would title registry keys, command-lines or even scheduled tasks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many organization lack a way of automatically applying IOCs to their monitoring and detection tools.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>IOCs that are true positives today may become obsolete tomorrow. IP addresses are reused, domains are taken down, and hashes of the same malware can change due to one changed byte in the malware.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Often, IOCs are shared without context or information about their relevance in a specific attack.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some IOCs, although they might be used by an attacker as described, have a high false-positive rate. Especially when Windows filenames are used as a means of defense evasion.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Many of these challenges are addressed, at least partially, by the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.misp-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>MISP Project&lt;/a>. A MISP provides predefined IOC types, the option to tag IOCs to enhance them with additional information, and a standardized format for sharing with others. You can connect a MISP with other instances globally or simply export MISP events as a file for publication. This enables defenders to easily import the event, ensuring that the information is presented in a semi-standardized format that can be utilized within their organization via APIs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are some key guidelines for sharing IOCs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If your IOCs are a picture, you are doing it wrong.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If some of your IOCs are spread over multiple lines, you are doing it wrong.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If your IOCs are only found in a PDF file, you are also doing it wrong.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At a minimum, you have to share the IOCs in a CSV with consistent type naming.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even better is the creation and export of a MISP event.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enrich your IOCs with metadata. Explain how, where, and when you discovered the IOC, its relevance in the attacker&amp;rsquo;s tactics, and whether it has a high false-positive rate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Classify your IOCs with Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) markings so that others understand how to handle them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a defender, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to have a MISP system in place and established processes for automatically incorporating new IOCs into your detection tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="signatures">Signatures
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The most common format for sharing &lt;strong>detection signatures&lt;/strong> for &lt;strong>files&lt;/strong> is YARA. YARA offers a standard for writing detection rules along with a scanner that can apply these signatures to a file system. If you have detected malware samples or other suspicious files during your incident investigation, you should bundle that knowledge in YARA signatures and share it with the community. If you&amp;rsquo;re new to YARA, Florian Roth has provided excellent tutorials on how to write effective YARA signatures&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nextron-systems.com/2015/02/16/write-simple-sound-yara-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>[6]&lt;/a> &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nextron-systems.com/2015/10/17/how-to-write-simple-but-sound-yara-rules-part-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>[7]&lt;/a> &lt;a class="link" href="https://cyb3rops.medium.com/how-to-post-process-yara-rules-generated-by-yargen-121d29322282" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>[8]&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For sharing detection signatures specific to logs, &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SIGMA&lt;/a> is the way to go. It serves as a generic signature format for SIEM systems. To quote the SIGMA description from their repository:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&amp;#34;Sigma is for log files what Snort is for network traffic and YARA is for files.&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The repository already provides a wide array of open-source signatures for common attacker techniques, along with a converter for various SIEM systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other signatures might include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Network-based signatures: &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.snort.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Snort&lt;/a> or &lt;a class="link" href="https://suricata.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Surricata&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>EDR-specific hunting queries (e.g. Defender for Endpoint hunting queries written in KQL)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="other-possible-contents-of-the-report">Other Possible Contents of the report
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In addition to the previously mentioned content, which should ideally be included in every threat report, there are several other valuable components that can enhance a threat report:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Malware analysis&lt;/strong>: This involves the thorough dissection and analysis of a malware sample to gain a deeper understanding of its functionality. Such analysis can provide insights into elements like Command and Control (C2) endpoints.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Comparison to Previous Attacks by the Same Threat Actor&lt;/strong>: By comparing the current attack to past incidents attributed to the same threat actor, it becomes possible to identify changes in their techniques or tactics over time. This historical perspective can be invaluable for anticipating their future actions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Investigative Research&lt;/strong>: Conducting further research to uncover additional tools, infrastructure, malware samples, and other resources employed by the threat actor. This extended investigation helps in building a more comprehensive profile of the adversary&amp;rsquo;s capabilities and activities.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

More often than not, half of the people in a meeting won&amp;rsquo;t even know what an abbreviation means, but nobody would dare to ask. Furthermore, it is nearly impossible for newcomers to grasp a topic when people consistently use abbreviations without explaining them. You can ask any employee of a company with more than 50,000 employees how much they appreciate abbreviations. Every department tends to have its own set of abbreviations, and company-wide, most abbreviations aren&amp;rsquo;t even unique. Okay, enough complaining about abbreviations; I think you&amp;rsquo;ve got the idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While I&amp;rsquo;ve expressed my frustration with abbreviations, this article aims to provide an introduction to the most commonly used terms in Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR). Oh wow, it&amp;rsquo;s not that difficult to write out an abbreviation, is it? The article also serves the purpose of defining terms that might have multiple meanings in different companies, countries, vendors, etc.&lt;/p>

&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Denial-of-Service (DOS)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>An attack with the goal of disrupting the availability of a system or service, often achieved by flooding the server with requests.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Digital Forensics (DF)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>The act of analyzing digital evidence to reach investigative goals, which can range from presenting results in court to understanding a cyberattack.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>

&lt;td>A DOS attack where the flooding comes from multiple systems, commonly achieved through request amplification or bot networks.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Endpoint Detection &amp;amp; Response (EDR)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>A security tool that detects threats and unusual behavior on endpoints and enables a company to respond effectively to alerts. EDR collects all endpoint events centrally and offers response features like isolation, containment, live response, and more, surpassing traditional antivirus solutions.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Entra ID&lt;/td>
&lt;td>See Azure Active Directory (AAD)&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Evidence Acquisition&lt;/td>
&lt;td>The process of collecting evidence for later forensic analysis, including disk images, memory images, triage packages, log files, single artifacts, malware samples, and more.&lt;/td>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Information Security (IS)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Focused on protecting information related to CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) within an organization.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Information Security Management System (ISMS)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>A framework for managing an organization&amp;rsquo;s sensitive data related to CIA, using a set of policies and procedures.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Network Operation Center (NOC)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>A team that monitors the network traffic of an organization. Many organizations don&amp;rsquo;t have a NOC anymore but rather a monitoring team in general or a SIEM team, which also covers network monitoring. Since network monitoring is only a part of a complete monitoring strategy, it often resolves in a large monitoring team.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Network Security Monitoring (NSM)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>The continuous monitoring of network traffic to detect malicious activity.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Remediation&lt;/td>
&lt;td>The act of mitigating an attack after it has occurred, aiming to regain control over the infrastructure, remove attackers from systems, and return to normal operations. Forensics analysis is essential for defining effective remediation measures, which may include reinstalling compromised systems, changing passwords on abused accounts, or enhancing security to prevent the same incident in the future.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Reverse Engineering (RE)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Part of malware analysis, involving reconstructing the original source code of a compiled malware sample to understand its functionality.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Security Incident Management Process (SIMP)&lt;/td>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Thor&lt;/td>
&lt;td>An IOC scanner specialized in detecting traces of attacks on endpoints, offering over 10,000 signatures and various modules for system scanning. A free variant, Thor-lite, is also available.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Threat Intelligence (TI)&lt;/td>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Threat Hunting&lt;/td>
&lt;td>The proactive search for traces of attacks within an organization, often initiated by new reports, ideas for identifying attackers, or management concerns. Threat hunting is commonly performed in EDR or SIEM systems.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>

&lt;td>TLP is a tagging system for shared information specifying sharing options for recipients. It includes four labels: TLP:RED (For recipient only), TLP:AMBER (Limited disclosure, e.g., within the organization), TLP:GREEN (Limited disclosure, e.g., within a community), and TLP:CLEAR (No limitations, shared information can be published).&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Windows Event Forwarding (WEF)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>The forwarding of Windows Event logs to a central server, which is supported by Windows by default and is for free, making it an excellent way to collect all Windows Event Logs in one place, simplifying log management.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>YARA (Yet Another Ridiculous Acronym)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>YARA provides a standard for writing detection signatures and offers a scanner to apply them to files or directories, serving as the de-facto standard for signature writing for files.&lt;/td>
