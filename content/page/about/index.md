Welcome to DFIR-Delight, my blog dedicated to the fascinating world of Incident Response and Digital Forensics!

I'm Moritz Oettle, an experienced Incident Responder and Digital Forensic analyst. Through this blog, I aim to share my knowledge and insights gained from years of working in the field.

Throughout my career, I've encountered a wide range of incidents, including Identity thefts, Frauds, DDoS Attacks, Ransomware attacks (with full encryption), Bad Insider Attacks, and APT Attacks. Each of these experiences has shaped my expertise in different aspects of incident response.

In various roles such as Coordination, Containment, Analysis, Monitoring, and Remediation, I've tackled these incidents head-on. I've had the privilege of working with different companies, from mid-sized organizations to large enterprises. This exposure has provided me with a deep understanding of security practices across the spectrum, from companies with limited security tools to those equipped with cutting-edge cyber technologies.

Next to my experiences in the field, I also gained the following certifications:

- [Certified X-Ways X-Pert](https://www.x-ways.net/x-pert/certificate.html?X=B876)
- [IT-Forensics Specialist](https://www.cbt-training.de/seminar/it-forensik-spezialist-cert-itfs.html)
- [Cyber Security Incident Manager](https://www.cbt-training.de/seminar/zertifizierung-zum-cyber-security-incident-manager.html)

Next to this blog, I am also sharing my knowledge in Incident Management as a CBT Trainer for the [CSIM](https://www.cbt-training.de/seminar/zertifizierung-zum-cyber-security-incident-manager.html) course. For those of you who don't know CBT, it's basically the german version for SANS :) In the course I teach the following topics:

- Security Incident Management Process (SIMP)
- How to organize Incident Response in a company
- How to build up and run a CDC
- The handling of daily incidents (like Phishing, Malware infections, etc.)
- Creation of Runbooks for specific incident types
- The handling of major incidents (like Ransomware, Bad Insider, APT, etc.)

By sharing my unique perspective and firsthand encounters with attacks in their various forms and variations, I hope to equip you with valuable insights and practical knowledge in the realm of Incident Response and Digital Forensics.

Join me on this journey as we delve into the intricacies of investigating, mitigating, and recovering from cyber incidents. Together, let's explore the ever-evolving landscape of DFIR and discover the strategies and techniques that can make a difference.

Thank you for visiting DFIR-Delight, and I look forward to sharing my expertise with you!
